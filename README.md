# NEXT.JS ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

This project compares popular alternatives to Next.js based on features and observations as of December 1, 2024. The focus is on how these frameworks meet specific requirements like SSR/SSG, file-based routing, SEO-friendliness, developer experience (DX), and more.

---

## **Why We Migrated from React.js to Next.js**
Key reasons for choosing Next.js:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **File-based Routing**
- **SEO Optimization**
- **Enhanced Developer Experience (DX)**
- **Large Community and Ecosystem**
- **Built-in Performance Optimization**
- **Support for Modern Web Features** like partial pre-rendering

The alternatives analyzed below are evaluated based on their ability to address these needs.

---

## **Case: Remix**
### **Project Setup**
- **Ease of Setup:** Single-command setup
- **Built-in Features:** TypeScript (TSX), Tailwind, Vite
- **Community Support:** Below average; lacks documentation and resources

### **Observations**
- Shadcn UI supported
- React Hook Form supported
- SSR and nested routing supported
- File-based routing supported (not as robust as Next.js)
- Server actions supported
- Decent DX
- **Summary:** Decent framework, but community support needs improvement.

---

## **Case: Astro**
### **Project Setup**
- **Ease of Setup:** Moderate
- **Built-in Features:** `.astro` templates, no Tailwind pre-configured
- Requires manual installation of React, Tailwind, and plugins

### **Observations**
- Supports TSX, MDX, Astro, components, and Tailwind
- SSR and page transitions supported
- Not SPA (Single Page Application)
- Inter-page state management differs significantly
- Best suited for blogs, static websites, or display applications
- Shadcn UI supported
- Decent DX
- Server actions supported
- **Summary:** Ideal for content-heavy websites, less suitable for dynamic applications.

---

## **Case: Routers (TanStack Router / React Router)**
### **Project Setup**
- **Ease of Setup:** Difficult; manual setup required
- **Built-in Features:** TSX, no Tailwind pre-configured
- Strong alignment with React

### **Observations**
- Not a full framework, more of a routing library
- SSR supported
- Minimal features compared to frameworks like Next.js
- Server actions supported
- Average DX
- **TanStack Router vs React Router:** TanStack offers more advanced features; React Router is simpler.
- **Summary:** Suitable for small, custom setups, but lacks many built-in features.

---

## **Case: SvelteKit**
### **Project Setup**
- **Ease of Setup:** Fairly easy
- **Built-in Features:** `.svelte`, TypeScript, no Tailwind pre-configured
- **Community Support:** Average

### **Observations**
- Codebase is less intuitive
- Supports SSR and API routes
- Server actions supported
- Unusual DX [subjective]
- File-based routing supported
- Has its own Shadcn-like UI support
- **Summary:** Unique but non-standard developer experience; great for niche use cases.

---

## **Case: SolidJS**
### **Project Setup**
- **Ease of Setup:** Fairly easy
- **Built-in Features:** TSX, Vite, no Tailwind pre-configured
- **Community Support:** Average

### **Observations**
- Very similar to Next.js in terms of code and architecture
- SSR supported
- Decent DX
- Nested routing and file-based routing supported
- Has its own Shadcn-like UI support
- **Summary:** Promising option with similarities to Next.js, but community size is a limitation.
